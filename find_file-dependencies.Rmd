title: "Find File Dependencies"
---

Assume that we have a directory tree filled with `R`-files.
We have reasonably numbered all files so that we know the order of file 
execution.
However, we have found out that there are some interdependencies between 
directories, which we have to know about in order to let users know the exact 
order of execution.

In this example, we have our `project`-directory and all relevant `R`-scripts 
are stored two levels deep into the file system. 
We will check for cross-dependencies by checking for all content-loading 
commands.
Finally, we will sort the original directory structure and save the output in 
`dependencies.txt`.

```{r, tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
find /path/to/project -maxdepth 2 -type f -name '*.R' | xargs grep -Rnw -e "readRDS" -e "source" -e "read.table" -e "scan" -e "fread" -e "read_delim" | sort -o dependencies.txt
```
