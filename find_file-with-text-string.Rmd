title: "Find Files With Text String"

Search for 'string' inside '/path/to/directory', but only consider files that either have ".r" or ".R" as a suffix. 
```{r, tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# Display the names of files that contain the string as well as the lines of string matches inside those files.
grep --include=\*.{R,r} -Rnw '/path/to/directory/' -e "string"

# Alternative (could be parallelized):
find . -type f --regex '.*\(R\|r\)$' | xargs grep -Rnw -e "string"

# Only display the names of files that contain the string.
grep --include=\*.{R,r} -Rwl '/path/to/directory/' -e "string"
```

Search for 'string' inside '/path/to/directory', but only consider files that do not have ".docx" or ".txt" as a suffix. 
```{r, tidy = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
grep --exclude=\*.{docx,txt} -Rnw '/path/to/directory/' -e "string"
```
