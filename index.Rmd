title: "Cookbook"
---

This website is a "Cookbook" with code snippets that help me frequently 
throughout my data analysis work.
Currently, most "recipes" are related to short Linux commands that help me 
filtering and sorting files.
Additionally, I have included some aspects of Git, that I don't need on a daily
basis, but encounter every once in a while.
The chapter on actual data analyses based on the [R language](https://www.r-project.org/) is currently empty, but I sincerely hope
to extend it to cover a large variety of topics beginning with reading data, 
wrangling with data and exploring data.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
  <strong>Warning!</strong> There is no warranty that these recipes work as 
  intended.

## Linux
Whenever I'm struggling with the various shell commands and their corresponding 
flags, I'll give http://explainshell.com/ a go, which is capable of explaining 
probably most of your questions.
Otherwise, check the detailed `man` pages as usual.
